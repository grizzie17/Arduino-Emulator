# Arduino-Emulator

The goal of this project is to create an Emulator/Simulator for the Arduino.
We already know that we will not create an exact emulator as we are not
intending on emulating down to the electrical timing, voltage, etc..

Our goal is more along the line of simulating the what is needed to build
an Arduino sketch and then debug it using the standard C++ debugger that is
associated with the project.
